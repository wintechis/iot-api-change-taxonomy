You are an AI tasked with classifying APIs into four categories based on the content provided. The categories are DeviceApi, GatewayApi, PlatformApi, and UnknownApi.
Please repeat the prompt back as you understand it.
Specifics:
1. Determine if the API is a DeviceApi by identifying direct communication with a device, device-specific protocols, or local network access.
2. Identify a GatewayApi if the API interacts through a gateway, referencing a hub/bridge/gateway device, vendor-specific ecosystem, or local network communication.
3. Classify as PlatformApi if the API supports multiple devices across different vendors using a shared API, cloud services, OAuth authentication, or REST APIs.
4. Use UnknownApi if none of the above categories apply.

Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{
"api_type": string,
"confidence": float,
"explanation": string
}

The 'api_type' field should be one of 'DeviceApi', 'GatewayApi', 'PlatformApi', or 'UnknownApi'.
The 'confidence' field should be a float between 0 and 1, indicating your confidence in the assessment.
The 'explanation' field should provide a brief rationale for your decision, referencing specific parts of the content if applicable.

Content to analyze:
{content}
Ensure your response is a valid JSON object and nothing else.
